        <div class="headline">How the Denver Nuggets' altitude advantage takes the air out of opposing teams</div>
  
        <div class="byline">By: Ohm Youngmisuk</div>
  
        <div class="date">May 31, 2023</div>


            <p> With the lights dimmed for the introduction of the starting lineups, Ball Arena directs everyone’s attention to the big screen for an urgent message.</p>

            <p>“ATTENTION, WARNING TO VISITORS.”</p>
            
            <p>Denver Nuggets public address announcer Kyle Speller proceeds to deliver a grim caution to the Los Angeles Lakers and their fans before the start of the Western Conference finals.</p>
            
            <p>“All visitors to the Mile High City be warned,” Speller says in an ominous voice. “High levels of exertion at this altitude may cause hypoxia with symptoms of fatigue, difficulty breathing, rapid heart rate, headaches and confusion.”</p>
            
            <p>The alert on the big screen begins to shake and blur as if altitude sickness has already set in. The next graphic shows an X-ray of an upper body with the chest area pulsating red. That is followed by a “Low Oxygen Levels” flash and the number “5280” with a heartbeat pulse darting across the screen.</p>
            
            <p>“You have been warned,” Speller says.</p>
            
            <p>Just like the Lakers were advised, from the moment when the Miami Heat walk off the bus past a mural that reads “Welcome to the Mile High City, 5,280’ above sea level” to the large “5280” next to each free throw line, the newly minted Eastern Conference champs will be reminded often they are no longer in South Beach, which boasts an elevation above sea level of just under Jimmy Butler’s 6-foot-7 height.</p>
            
            <p>Denver not only owns the most suffocating home-court advantage in the NBA, but no active franchise in history has had more success at home compared to on the road.</p>
            
            <p>The altitude isn’t a myth.</p>

            <p>“Yeah, it’s real,” Lakers star LeBron James said before Game 1 of the West finals. “You get tired a lot faster.”</p>

            <p>When the Nuggets return to the court after a nine-day break for Game 1, the fabled Mile High altitude will make its NBA Finals debut. The Nuggets are 8-0 this postseason at Ball Arena, where they posted the second-best regular-season home record at 34-7 (Memphis was 35-6).</p>
            
            <p>Trying to keep the 6-11, 284-pound Nikola Jokic out of the paint and off the glass while also chasing Jamal Murray through screens is that much more daunting when opponents feel like they need an oxygen mask while their legs and lungs tighten.</p>
            
            <p>In case the Heat — winless in Denver since the 2016-17 season — don’t feel the altitude physically, the Nuggets will do all they can to make them feel weaker mentally.</p>
            
            <p>“That s— real,” Hall of Famer Kevin Garnett said recently on Showtime’s “KG Certified. “You know what [the Nuggets] do before games just to f— with your mental? ‘Welcome to Denver. If you start feeling faint. It’s because you are above [sea level] …’</p>
            
            <p>“You’re like in the layup line, did you hear that s—? Yo, hold on. Whoa! Whoa! Did that [PA announcer] just say [5,280 feet]?</p>
            
            <p>“You start having a panic attack.”</p>

        <div class="chapter-headline">
            <h1> An Invisible Advantage </h1>
        </div>

            <p>From Anthony Edwards tossing a chair on his way off the floor after missing a 3 at the buzzer to force overtime for the Minnesota Timberwolves to Kevin Durant turning the ball over seven times in a Phoenix Suns loss, to James stunningly blowing a layup and later letting the ball slip out of his hands on a breakaway dunk, opponents have experienced some inexplicable out of character moments in Denver this postseason.</p>

            <p>Nuggets forward Aaron Gordon knows what it is like to not feel like yourself in Denver, especially when visiting from Florida. Gordon needed to become a Colorado resident in order to feel acclimated to the Rockies. </p>
            
            <p>“Most definitely, oh my God,” Gordon said of whether he felt the altitude when he used to play at Denver during his six and a half seasons with the Orlando Magic. “Couldn’t even feel my muscles. I feel like there wasn’t even enough oxygen getting into my muscles when I played here. It was crazy. … </p>
            
            <p>“It takes maybe a week or two to get acclimated to it.” </p>
            
            <p>It’s no wonder why the Nuggets own an all-time home winning percentage of .652. Away from Denver, the Nuggets are a paltry .350 all time. That .302 difference between home and road win percentage is the largest for any active franchise in NBA history, according to ESPN Stats & Information research. </p>
            
            <p>The Denver altitude can get the best of everyone from savvy veterans to draft prospects. The Nuggets have had to cut some draft workouts short after seeing players turn pale and get sick. </p>
            
            <p>“One of the main things that players coming into town feel is that they get desperate [for air],” said director of performance/head strength and conditioning coach Felipe Eichenberger, who has been with the Nuggets for 13 years. “You go for a sprint, you come back and you go for another sprint and all a sudden you just try to pull air. And then I feel like the players [feel], why can I not breathe?” </p>
